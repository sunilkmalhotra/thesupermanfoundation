<h1>Treatment for AC</h1>
<h2>Medications</h2>
<p>
  Medications can be used to decrease the number of episodes and the severity of an arrhythmia, and alter the electrical properties of the heart in one of two ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Directly:</strong> The medications affect the electrical currents in the heart.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Indirectly:</strong> Medications (beta blockers) block the effects of adrenaline or improve blood flow to the heart.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Drugs used in AC treatment such as beta-blockers and antiarrhythmogenic agents (sotalol and amiodarone) are commonly used to reduce arrhythmias. Beta-blockers are sometimes used to slow the heart rate, blood pressure, and counter the effects of adrenaline, which seem to play a part in causing abnormal heart rhythms. Sotalol appears to be the most effective antiarrhythmic drug to prevent ventricular tachycardia in patients with AC. Amiodarone alone or in combination with beta-blocking drugs may be an alternative for those patients not responding to other drug therapies, but frequent side effects of amiodarone during long-term therapy in young patients limit this particular treatment. Beta-blockers and ACE­ Inhibitors are also used, as they have shown useful to slowing disease progression in other heart diseases. However, evidence of their effectiveness with AC is lacking. You must keep a close (professional) relationship with your doctor to monitor the effectiveness of your medications in controlling your arrhythmias.

<h2>ICDs/Implantation</h2>
<p>
  Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are commonly used to treat AC patients. These devices continuously monitor the heartbeat and automatically deliver a small electrical shock to the heart if an irregular heartbeat or rapid sustained heart rhythm occurs. This may cause a momentary discomfort, which is described by some patients as being “kicked in the chest.”
</p>
<p>
  ICDs also can function as pacemakers to treat both slow and fast rhythms. If for some reason a decision is made not to implant an ICD, very close monitoring and frequent checkups are needed for those individuals experiencing symptoms of AC.
</p>
<p>
  Fun Fact: The implantation of ICDs for prevention of sudden death is more common in the	United States than Europe.
</p>
<p>
  The ICD is surgically implanted by making a 2-inch incision beneath the collarbone and creating a “pocket” for the device. Wires (leads) that are attached to the device are inserted into veins that lead to the heart. Doctors tests the effectiveness of an implanted ICD by triggering an  artificial abnormal heart rhythm to ensure that the ICD will detect and stop the abnormal heart rhythm. The surgery is done either as an outpatient surgery or an overnight surgery, and heavily depends on the age of the patient and the severity of their condition.
</p>
<p>
  For a few days to weeks after surgery, you may experience pain, swelling, and/or tenderness in the area where the ICD was implanted. Your doctor will help you decide how soon you can resume your normal activities and what pain medications to take. Most people return to their normal activities within a few days of their surgery. Many patients note that they feel much more assurance and safety that the ICD will correct any abnormal rhythms if needed, and return to the lifestyle they enjoyed before surgery. Generally speaking, work, hobbies, non-strenuous exercise and travel are possible after ICD surgery.
</p>
<p>
  ICDs should be checked every 3-6 months and usually replaced every 4-10 years, or if any complications arise. It’s extremely important to follow your doctor’s instructions after surgery. Since each person’s medical case is different, it’s best to discuss with your doctor if an ICD is the best treatment for you.
</p>
<h2>MRI’s for AC patients with ICDs</h2>
<p>
  A MRI can be used to detect many diseases such as cancer, orthopedic injuries, and more. Until recently, patients with ICDs were unable to have a MRI because of the risk of the MRI’s heat, vibrations and magnetic field causing the ICD to malfunction. Precautions can now be made by programming the ICD into a “safe” mode for the MRI. In case of any problems, the ICD is consistently monitored throughout the procedure. Following the MRI, the ICD is checked to make sure it’s working properly again.
</p>
<p><strong>
  Many people can undergo the MRI safely, but more data is needed to make sure it would be safe for everyone.
</strong></p>
<p>
  MRI’s are being performed in patients with ICDs in academic centers at present. Guidelines are being written so that non-academic centers will be able to conform in the future.
</p>
<h2>Catheter Ablation</h2>
<p>
  To treat AC with catheter ablation, the areas of the heart causing arrhythmias are located and cauterized (burned) to destroy the tissue. This invasive procedure is performed in an electrophysiology laboratory and potentially will reduce the frequency of arrhythmic episodes.
</p>
<p>
  Traditional (endocardial) catheter ablation treats the muscle in the inside surface of the heart. An arhythmic area is pinpointed and cauterized by sending catheters through veins in the legs and followed up into the heart. Catheter ablation can help reduce the need for ICD therapy.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, a promising ablation technique called epicardial ablation has been developed. In this technique, the outside of the heart is treated. Many AC arrhythmias come from the outside of the heart. This procedure is done by maneuvering the catheter under the breast bone and into the sac around the heart. Although this can be very effective at treating arrhythmias in ARVD/C patients, this is a complicated procedure.
</p>
<p>
  Catheter ablation is not a final cure for AC due to its progressive nature. It is important for patients to have a careful discussion with their physicians about the risks and benefits of catheter ablation before undergoing this procedure.
</p>
<h2>Failure to Treat</h2>
<p>
  A minority of AC patients may need a heart transplant due to progressive loss of heart muscle, uncontrollable arrhythmias, and no other treatment is successful.
