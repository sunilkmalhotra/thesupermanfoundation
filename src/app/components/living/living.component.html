<h1>Living with AC</h1>
<h2>AC and exercise</h2>
<p>
An important recommendation for individuals with AC is exercise restriction. In some patients, exercise has been known to provoke arrhythmias, and sometimes can even lead to sudden cardiac death. Exercise, depending on the intensity and duration, as well as the progression of the disease in a particular patient, may accelerate progression (this is based on experimental data and clinical observations). It is not yet known what intensity of exercise is safe, and there appears to be an increased incidence of AC in young, very athletic individuals, especially men. Exercise is assumed to place additional strain on heart muscle connections that are already weak. So, it is recommended that competitive athletics and endurance sports should be restricted in patients with AC, and that patients should focus on mild aerobic exercise such as walking or playing golf. If higher levels of exercise are performed, depending on what your doctor says, it should be limited in duration and intensity as much as possible. It’s best to talk to your doctor about what types of exercise are right for you.
</p>
<h2>The Effects of Stimulants</h2>
<p>
  Patients who are prone to arrhythmias are generally advised to avoid stimulants of all kinds, such as nicotine and caffeine, Sudafed (pseudoephedrine), found in cold/flu medications.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    People with AC can get arrhythmias without taking stimulants or exposure to alcohol.
  </strong>
</p>
<h2>Pregnancy and Gene Testing</h2>
<p>
  The decision of persons with AC to conceive a child is difficult and should be made on a case-by-case basis.
</p>
<p>
  Although there is little information on pregnancy on patients with AC, women have had uncomplicated pregnancies, even with those who have an ICD or are taking medications. However, there are some medications that can harm the baby as it develops, so you will need to talk to your doctor to see if he/she would recommend that you switch medications temporarily. Pregnancy does put extra strain on the heart. If you are planning a pregnancy, or become pregnant, you should consult your cardiologist and obstetrician as soon as possible, and ask about medication options/delivery options, as well as monitoring of your heart during labor.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have the mutation, there is a 50% chance that the mutation will be passed to a child.
</p>
<p>
  Genetic testing is possible for a fetus. Some couples may request pre-natal diagnosis through amniocentesis at the beginning of the pregnancy to determine the genetic status of the fetus Some also consider terminating the pregnancy if the gene mutation is present, but ethical and legal issues apply in these situations. According to geneticists, even if a genetic test is positive in the fetus, it will not tell you the severity of the disease for the child. The gene may be present without doing damage or it could cause signs and/or symptoms of AC in the person once they get older.
</p>
<p>
  Adoption, artificial insemination using donated mature eggs or sperm, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis are alternatives/options.
</p>
<h2>Flu Vaccinations</h2>
<p>
  Patients who have a chronic health condition such as heart disease are more at risk for complications from the flu. Doctors usually recommend being vaccinated for both the seasonal flu swine flu (H1N1). These are separate vaccinations. If you have heart disease, get the shot, not the inhaled mist vaccine, as the shot contains killed virus (can’t make you sick), whereas the mist form contains a living, but weakened, live virus. You should also receive both vaccinations to reduce the odds getting an AC patient at risk if you are a family member/caregiver of the AC patient. Speak with your doctor immediately if you think you may be coming down with the flu. Seek emergency treatment if you have any of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Difficulty breathing/shortness of breath
  </li>
  <li>
    Temperature over 101°F
  </li>
  <li>
    Pain/pressure in the chest/abdomen
  </li>
  <li>
    Sudden dizziness/confusion
  </li>
  <li>
    Persistent/severe vomiting
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Long Term</h2>
<p>
  AC patients usually inquire about what will happen to their heart. Some patients will have bouts with arrhythmias that require changes in medications, procedures and/or ablations. The majority of people who stop doing strenuous exercise early on in the course of their AC diagnosis do quite well. Once arrhythmias are controlled, very few patients in the U.S. die from AC. The ICD offers protection from sudden cardiac death, and it is the most common form of treatment (currently).
</p>
<p>
Patients may eventually develop heart failure and might require heart transplantation, but is extremely rare.
</p>
<p>
The progression of AC is usually slow. Currently, it is difficult to determine the progression of the disease in specific patients, which makes additional research extremely necessary, so that it will be possible to determine which AC patients are at high risk, or likely to be, for sudden cardiac arrest.
</p>
<p>
The long-term outlook for most AC patients is good. Individuals are currently being diagnosed with AC in a much earlier stage of the disease’s progression thanks to Thanks to improved cardiac imaging and genetic testing. Huge advances have been made in the understanding this disease since the first clinical diagnosis in 1982.
</p>
<p>
Today, doctors believe that most people who die from AC weren’t diagnosed before their death. The diagnosis of AC cam come as surprise to some, and as an “ah-ha” moment for others, as these people have had a long history of symptoms that they were never able to understand. Either way, patients and their families may feel a sudden loss of well-being, as with any diagnosis of something of the sort, it takes time to adjust to the lifestyle, physical, emotional, and mental changes that accompany AC heart disease. People learn to deal with these issues and cope with the disease through exploring AC and learning that with proper medical care and a few lifestyle adjustments, they can live healthy and productive lives.
