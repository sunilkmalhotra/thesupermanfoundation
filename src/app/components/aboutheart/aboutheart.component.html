<h1>About the Human Heart</h1>
<p>
  The human heart is roughly the size of a large fist and weighs between about 10 to 12 ounces (280 to 340 grams) in men and 8 to 10 ounces (230 to 280 grams) in women. Its primary function is to pump blood throughout the body (circulatory system), supply oxygen and nutrients to tissue around the body, and remove carbon dioxide and other wastes. The heart circulates blood through two pathways: the pulmonary circuit and the systemic circuit. In the pulmonary circuit, deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery and travels to the lungs, then returns as oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary vein. In the systemic circuit, oxygenated blood leaves the body through the left ventricle to the aorta, and from there enters the arteries and capillaries where it supplies the body's tissues with oxygen. Deoxygenated blood returns through veins to the venae cavae, re-entering the heart's right atrium. The cardiovascular system circulates blood from the heart to the lungs and around the body via blood vessels. After the blood leaves the heart through the aortic valve, two sets of arteries bring oxygenated blood to feed the heart muscle. The left main coronary artery, on one side of the aorta, branches into the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery. The right coronary artery branches out on the right side of the aorta.

  <p>
  The human heart has four chambers: two upper chambers (the atria, fill with the blood returning to the heart from the body and lungs) and two lower ones (the ventricles, squirt out the blood to the body and lungs). A wall of muscle called the septum separates the two sides of the heart. A double-walled sac called the pericardium encases the heart, which protects it and maintains its position inside the chest. Between the outer layer, the parietal pericardium, and the inner layer, the serous pericardium, runs pericardial fluid, which lubricates the heart during contractions and movements of the lungs and diaphragm. The heart's outer wall consists of three layers. The outermost wall layer (epicardium) is the inner wall of the pericardium.  The middle layer (myocardium) contains the muscle that contracts. The inner layer (endocardium) is the lining that contacts the blood. The tricuspid valve and the mitral valve make up the atrioventricular (AV) valves, which connect the atria and the ventricles. The pulmonary semi-lunar valve separates the right ventricle from the pulmonary artery, and the aortic valve separates the left ventricle from the aorta. The heartstrings (chordae tendinae) anchor the valves to heart muscles. The sinoatrial node produces the electrical pulses that drive heart contractions.

Your heart muscle is made of tiny cells. Your heart's electrical system controls the timing of your heartbeat by sending an electrical signal through these cells.Two different types of cells in your heart enable the electrical signal to control your heartbeat:
</p>
<p>
The electrical signal travels through the network of conducting cell "pathways," which stimulates your upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles) to contract. The signal is able to travel along these pathways by means of a complex reaction that allows each cell to activate one next to it, stimulating it to "pass along" the electrical signal in an orderly manner. As cell after cell rapidly transmits the electrical charge, the entire heart contracts in one coordinated motion, creating a heartbeat. First, the SA node (called the pacemaker of the heart) sends out an electrical impulse. Then, the upper heart chambers (atria) contract. The AV node then sends an impulse into the ventricles. Following this, the lower heart chambers (ventricles) contract or pump. Finally, the SA node sends another signal to the atria to contract, which starts the cycle over again. This cycle of an electrical signal followed by a contraction is one heartbeat.
